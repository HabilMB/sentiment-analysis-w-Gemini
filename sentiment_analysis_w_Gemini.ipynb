I've been using for a couple months and if you're an amazon prime subscriber the value here is greater than google. I'm using to listen to free music with prime (better than alternatives), audible and you can even watch movies. The display is a little small for lots of watching, the sound should be louder, and YOUTUBE NEEDS TO BE AVAILABLE. These issues put this at a 3.5 to 4 stars. Fix one of them (youtube) and its a 5 star item. To alleviate sound I've paired with a blue tooth speaker. Right now this sits in my living area. Where I think it will shine is my office desk. Once there are great offers I could see purchasing additional for nightstand or other Amazon Alexa items for my household.

Fix one of them (youtube) and its a 5 star item. To alleviate sound I've paired with a blue tooth speaker. Right now this sits in my living area. Where I think it will shine is my office desk.

Capital Accumulation:**\n> \n> * The richest 1% have accumulated significant wealth through investments, stock ownership, and real estate holdings.\n> * They benefit from compounding returns over time, which further increases their wealth.\n> \n> **2. Economic Concentration:**\n> \n> * Globalization has led to the centralization of wealth in a few large corporations and industries.\n> * This allows the owners and executives of these corporations to accumulate vast fortunes.\n> \n> **3. Technological Advances:**\n> \n> * Automation and the growth of the digital economy have created opportunities for the wealthy to exploit technological advancements and profit from intellectual property.\n> \n> **4. Government Policies:**\n> \n> * Tax cuts that favor the wealthy and deregulation of financial markets have widened the income gap.\n> * Subsidies for corporations and wealthy individuals further contribute to their economic advantage.\n> \n> **5. Historical Legacies:**\n> \n> * Inherited wealth plays a significant role in perpetuating income inequality.\n> * The wealthy are more likely to pass on their wealth to their children, who then have a head start in life.\n> \n> **6. Lack of Social Mobility:**\n> \n> * Educational and healthcare disparities make it difficult for people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to improve their financial situation.\n> * Discrimination and structural barriers also hinder social mobility.\n> \n> **7. Political Influence:**\n> \n> * The wealthy have disproportionate influence over political decision-making and can shape policies that favor their interests.\n> * They fund political campaigns and lobby for policies that protect their wealth.\n> \n> **8. Globalized Labor Market:**\n> \n> * Globalization has allowed corporations to outsource labor to low-wage countries, reducing employment opportunities and wages for workers in developed nations.\n> \n> **9. Wealth Diversification:**\n> \n> * The wealthy invest their wealth in multiple assets, including stocks, bonds, real estate, and precious metals.\n> * This diversification reduces risk and further increases their returns.\n> \n> **10. Tax Loopholes and Offshore Accounts:**\n> \n> * The wealthy often exploit tax loopholes and use offshore accounts to minimize their tax liability.\n> * This allows them to accumulate more wealth and avoid contributing their fair share to society."
